## Introduction  

As we look out the window today in mid-autumn, the leaves are turning multiple colors and people are longing to walk under the branches.  We wanted to find a way to plan trips to various parks for families, individuals, or any group of people wanting to experience nature.  

- Create a website about parks integrating available web data sources. (We will begin with U.S. National Park data and integrate state and local data as it becomes available.)
- Have users share content (statuses, trips, reviews or photos) of parks visited
- Provide available park amenity data to users to help them plan visits
- Integrate online weather data from another source to provide additional information to people wishing to visit parks.

Ultimately, we would like to create a better experience for people who want to be out in nature and enjoy our park resources through this web application.
